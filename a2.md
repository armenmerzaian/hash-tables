# Part A

Analyze the functions listed, below, state the final answer (in big-O notation) into the table.  A proper analysis is required below.

## Summary table

| Function | run time with respect to number of records in table | 
|---|---|
| numRecords() | O(n) |
| insert() - if item does not exist  | O(n ^ 2) |
| modify - if item does exist  | O(n ^ 2) |
| find() - if item is not there | O(n) |
| remove() - if item is there | O(n ^ 2) |
| copy constructor | O(n ^ 2) |
| move constructor | O(1) |
| move assignment operator  | O(n ^ 2) |
| destructor  | O(n ^ 2) |

## Analysis

# Part B

* Suggestion 1: In the insert function, the first for loop uses n clock cycles to check if the key already exists. The same loop can be used to also check for the location to place the data pair instead of looping through the table again after.
* Suggestion 2: For the numRecords() function, to avoid performing a O(n) calculation everytime this is ran, a class variable int numRecords could be stored and increment with the insert function instead. numRecords() would then call this variable instead and save the O(n) run everytime.
* Suggestion 3: In the remove function, it first loops to check if the key exists and loops again to delete the key, you can save a O(n) operation if the first loop finds the key and deletes the key in the same operation.

# Part D

## Experiment Description

In this experiment I will compare the performances the performance of the find() function for the two tables.

## Results

From testing LP Table works the fastest for a load factor under 0.8 and for chaining table a load factor over 1.0. For each table, I tested the time for the find function within the tables most efficient ranges. I tested for multiple data sizes (500, 1000, 15000).

For LP Table I used load factor 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. Over 0.8, LP loses efficiency.
For Chaining Table I used load factor 1, 1.4, 1.8. Under 1.0, Chaining loses efficiency.

I searched for an item that cannot be found in the table, this way I can test the worse possible scenario.

Loadfactor does determine how well a table performs, LP Table is fastest around 0.6 LF and Chaining Table is the fastest around 1.4 LF. However, for these tests it looks like LP Table is generally faster but that could be due to the algorithm being written more efficiently.
