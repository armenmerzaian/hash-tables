# Part A

Analyze the functions listed, below, state the final answer (in big-O notation) into the table.  A proper analysis is required below.

## Summary table

| Function | run time with respect to number of records in table | 
|---|---|
| numRecords() | O(n) |
| insert() - if item does not exist  | O(n ^ 2) |
| modify - if item does exist  | O(n ^ 2) |
| find() - if item is not there | O(n) |
| remove() - if item is there | O(n ^ 2) |
| copy constructor | O(n ^ 2) |
| move constructor | O(1) |
| move assignment operator  | O(n ^ 2) |
| destructor  | O(n ^ 2) |

## Analysis


# Part B

* Suggestion 1: In the insert function, the first for loop uses n clock cycles to check if the key already exists. The same loop can be used to also check for the location to place the data pair instead of looping through the table again after.
* Suggestion 2: For the numRecords() function, to avoid performing a O(n) calculation everytime this is ran, a class variable int numRecords could be stored and increment with the insert function instead. numRecords() would then call this variable instead and save the O(n) run everytime.
* Suggestion 3: In the remove function, it first loops to check if the key exists and loops again to delete the key, you can save a O(n) operation if the first loop finds the key and deletes the key in the same operation.
